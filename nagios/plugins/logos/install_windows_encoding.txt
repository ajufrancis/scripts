You fuckin' nerds ever heard of a thing called Nagios? You did, you know this is some really good shit - open source monitoring tool, efficient, stable, fucking helpful. Well, there's just this little fucking problem with Nagios - it was written by unaesthetic nerds like you, so it's fucking webGUI look like ancient crap and sucks big balls. Not to mention shitty status map with fucking 4-color HGA icons. It makes your so-called girlfriend with some vista and HD experience wanna yack up on a fucking screen. Well, she's not the one to blame.

Well boy, just don't fucking panic. Here we are, to serve you no-life motherfucker. First of all, download this icon pack for nagios, and place them in appriopriate folder (/usr/local/www/nagios/images/logos in FreeBSD for fucking example). If you don't know how to bind icons to corresponding host on you map - then you're a fucking moron.

Second, you have to download sources for Nagios (if you installed it from APT, PKG or some other shit). The thing is that fucking Nagios draws status map as a one fucking 256-color image. Thus, if you use multiple icons from that fancy package, each one with different indexed pallete - your status map will look even worse than before. So, after download, edit a file called statusmap.c in /cgi directory. Find a line:

	map_image=gdImageCreate(canvas_width, canvas_height);

and fucking replace it with:

	map_image=gdImageCreateTrueColor(canvas_width, canvas_height);

Below that, add the following line:

	gdImageFill(map_image, 0, 0, 0xFFFFFF);

About ten lines below, there should be a line like this:

	gdImageColorTransparent(map_image,color_white);

...be fucking extra sure it says color_white there. Now, replace these two lines:

	color_lightred=gdImageColorAllocate(map_image,215,175,175);
	color_lightgreen=gdImageColorAllocate(map_image,210,255,215);

...with corresponding:

	color_lightred=gdImageColorAllocate(map_image,255,228,228);
	color_lightgreen=gdImageColorAllocate(map_image,217,255,224);

After saving changes, go to the root of nagios source dir and type in:

	./configure
	make cgis

If you encounter any problems with the compile process - fucking solve it. I'm not a fucking babysitter. Be fucking sure you don't type make install - unless of course you don't have Nagios already installed in your system.

After all, copy & overwrite statusmap.cgi in your Nagios /cgi-bin directory. Fucking done!
