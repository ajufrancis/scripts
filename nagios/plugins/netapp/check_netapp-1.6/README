This script is made in an all-in-one fashion similar to my HP/Compaq plugins.
It is made in perl, only uses numeric OIDs (no need for the netapp MIBs) and
"should" therefor be quite fast.

A single run like "./check_netapp -H HOSTNAME -C COMMUNITY" will check the
following hardware states:

- fsOverallStatus 
- all raidPStatus entries 
- enclPowerSuppliesStatus 
- enclFansStatus 
- enclElectronicsStatus 
- enclTempSensorsOverTempStatus (warnings and failures) 

and the following configuration states:

- quota hard limits (qrV2QuotaUnlimited) 
- quota soft limits (qrV2SoftQuotaUnlimited) 
- quota thresholds (qrV2ThresholdUnlimited) 

You can either have all checks executed by just specifying the hostname and
community string as parameters or you can use the --include switch to state
which checks you want executed. See --help for more information.

Please update the 'lib' path at the top of check_netapp to fit your
distribution.  check_netapp needs to locate the utils.pm library that comes
with nagios-plugins.
