Version 1.6
===========

Added an option for short message output on quota/threshold checks. Corrected
documentation for threshold check.

Version 1.5
===========

Output cleaned up and simplified.

Version 1.4
===========

Since I made the check of fsOverallStatus optional it would have been a good
idea to initialize that variable :-) Bug fixed.

Version 1.3
===========

Jim's request is now implemented:

"In the long run, I think adding switches to exclude any of the checks would be
good. For example, I have one filer where we have Exchange maintaining a
fixed-size database on one volume with no snapshots. So that volume always
appears full, but that state is ok in our book."

So far so good... this should be working now. There is an INCLUDE switch, that
you may use in order to activate just the checks you need (see --help for more
information).

Version 1.2
===========

Another useful comment by Jim:

"This weekend our regularly scheduled disk scrubbing caused check_netapp to go
into warning state, because the plugin regards any response to the raid check
that isn't '1' or '6' to be a warning state. The truth is that most of the
possible states are OK states â€” just a couple are problems."

So this has now changed to regard the RAID states as follows:

 crit = 6
 warn = 2 3
 ok   = 1 4 5 7 8

Thanks again!

Version 1.1
===========

This is an update to correct a "it's a feature not a bug" situation reported
by Jim King, where filers with disabled quotas would cause the plugin to bail
out giving an error message.

Thanks to Jim King for pointing out this issue!

Version 1.0
===========

First public release.
